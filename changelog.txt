1.3.16
-Hotkey support, hover over an entity and CTRL-F to autofill

1.3.16 Current known issues:
Bob's Batteries are not getting inserted in tank-3 and OMG I can't figure out why
Removing a mod which has a fuel item in the autofill table will cause crash on next autofill. /c remote.call("af","resetUser") might fix for now.
Ammo is not prioritized correctly for bob's if you have piercing rounds and nuke bullets in your inventory it will prefer the piercing rounds.
No migration scripts
Hotkey Filling will not fill fuel if fuel in inv has a higher value then fuel in entity
Hotkey Filling will fill trunk space if vehicle is full
